Credit Card Processing

( test application for publicis sapient role )

# Target

Create a node.js application that will process credit card creation.
We'll use express and produce a RESTful API.
We will also use Typescript to avoid runtime errors as much as possible.

# How to run

( assuming node.js is installed )

1.  `yarn` to install dependencies
2.  `yarn build` to build the project
    3a. `yarn start` to start the server
    3b. `yarn start-dev` to start the server in development mode (with nodemon)

The server will listen to the port 3000.

A swagger UI documentation is available at `/docs`.
